Title: ArchLinuxMIPS.org now online
Date: 2014-05-24 21:18

Today ArchLinuxMIPS.org (or more affectionately, "almo") is online. It's early
days and lots is still to come, but hopefully this site is at least more
informative than the placeholder that was previously here :)

I intend to expand the content of this site in the coming days & tie it together
with (the third and hopefully long lasting version of) the Arch Linux MIPS build
infrastructure in order to provide useful information such as package
information, build state & access to build logs. I will also be adding pages
detailing how to install Arch Linux MIPS to various targets, beginning with
QEMU.

Finally a note that for anyone who's interested this website, like the rest of
Arch Linux MIPS, is open source. You can find its source
[over at GitHub](https://github.com/Arch-Linux-MIPS/website).
